# House Price Prediction - Regression Analysis with Python

## **Description**
This project utilizes a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, and the number of rooms. The goal of this project is to explore regression analysis techniques and understand the relationship between these features and the target variable, which is the house price.

## **Project Overview**
The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Loaded the dataset and performed initial inspection to check for missing values.
   - Analyzed the distribution of numerical features and checked for outliers.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Applied feature scaling for numerical data (e.g., size, number of rooms) to bring them to a comparable range.
   - Categorical variables, like location, should be encoded for the regression model (Note: Encoding not explicitly shown in the current code).

3. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained a linear regression model to predict house prices.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the model using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination).
   - Outputted the predicted house prices and compared them to actual values.

## **Tech Stack**
- Python
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning model)
- numpy (for numerical operations)
